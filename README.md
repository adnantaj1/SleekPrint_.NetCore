## Database Design
The database is structured into several key tables reflecting different aspects of the e-commerce platform:

### Categories

- **Title** (string): Product title, required.
- **Description** (string): Description of the product.
- **ArticleNumber** (string): International Standard Article Number, required for products.
- **ListPrice** (double): Suggested retail price.
- **Price** (double): Price for quantities between 1-50.
- **Price50** (double): Price for quantities between 51-100.
- **Price100** (double): Price for quantities above 100.
- **CategoryId** (int): Foreign key linked to Categories.
- **ImageUrl** (string): URL to an image of the product.

### ApplicationUser
- Inherits from IdentityUser, adding additional fields:
  - **Name** (string): Full name of the user, required.
  - **StreetAddress**, **City**, **State**, **PostalCode** (string): Address fields.
  - **CompanyId** (int, nullable): Optional foreign key that links to the Company table.

- **OrderHeader** and **OrderDetail** tables manage the details and line items of orders respectively.
  - **OrderHeader**: Includes fields for total amount, date of order, status, and user details.
  - **OrderDetail**: Includes fields for product, quantity, and price per unit.

This schema ensures that all aspects of product management, user management, and order processing are handled efficiently within the application.
